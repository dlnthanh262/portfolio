      "content": "<p>Notice, Smile, and Let Go, so I can truly be <strong>FREE</strong></p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1CsgtFo5QQsbL-DL14Nqsw.jpeg\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/search?format=search&amp;last_filter=query&amp;last_value=freedom&amp;query=freedom\">Freepik</a></figcaption></figure><p>Somewhere inside every success story you have, there’s a little seed of arrogance quietly waiting for you to notice it.</p><p>If I’m honest, I’m not immune to it either.</p><p>Back in high school, I once won First Prize in a city-wide Literature contest. My family and I were over the moon. But right at that moment when my name was called, I felt something strange rise up inside me. I was happy, yes, but there was also this little… “I’m special” kind of pride. I remember thinking: “So, I guess I really am better than a lot of people.” Looking back, I can still picture my smile that day. Only one word: <strong>proud</strong>.</p><p>But not exactly innocent anymore.</p><p>Later on, when I started getting invited to speak at my old company events and share with other colleagues, that feeling came back. Every time I stepped on stage, heard the applause, saw the admiration in people’s eyes… something inside me inflated. If I told you I was completely humble back then, I’d be lying. Part of me really did feel “above” the audience, like I was someone special.</p><p>And I know that feeling is dangerous.</p><p>It swept me away, made me forget that I was just a regular person sharing my experiences, not some guru sent to enlighten the masses.</p><p>Maybe you’ve felt this too. After getting a high grade, receiving a compliment, or enjoying a little spotlight on social media,… you feel on top of the world… and then you want more. That’s when it becomes a trap. The more you crave recognition, the more you fear losing it: fear of being outshined, fear of falling behind.</p><p>As students, arrogance sneaks in quietly. Sometimes it’s as simple as comparing test scores. One person gets B+, another gets A, and suddenly the A feels “above” the B+. But that happiness is short-lived, because the next second, they see someone with A+ and feel small again. Arrogance always comes with comparison. It can’t stand alone. It only exists when we put ourselves on a scale next to others. That’s why arrogance is never satisfied. The more you feed it, the hungrier and more fragile it becomes.</p><p>How about today’s social media? It’s like a giant magnifying glass for arrogance. A photo that gets a lot of likes, a story full of compliments, a small achievement shared widely… all become fuel for the ego. You start feeling “different,” “special,” and then you feel trapped by that image you’ve created. You stop living for yourself and start living to protect the glow others see in you. You forget that learning, working, creating are supposed to be joyful in themselves, not just proof that you’re better than someone else.</p><p>If you look a little deeper, you’ll see arrogance is just a mask for fear. People brag because they’re afraid of being ignored. They compare because they’re scared of being left behind.</p><p>Arrogance isn’t strength. It’s a defense mechanism.</p><p>It’s like wearing shiny armor so everyone is dazzled by you, but inside, your heart is trembling, terrified that one day the shine will fade.</p><p>But what if… when you scored well, instead of thinking “I’m better than them,” you simply smiled because your hard work paid off? What if… when you got praised online, instead of pressuring yourself to stay perfect, you just thought, “I’m glad this resonated with someone”? What if… when you were chosen as team leader, you saw it as a chance to learn to listen, not a chance to show power? Success would suddenly feel lighter, purer, no longer weighed down by arrogance.</p><p>For me, the hardest part isn’t killing arrogance. It’s daring to notice it. The next time I catch myself comparing or feeling smug, I definitely don’t push it away. Just smile and whisper to myself: “Ah, I’m being arrogant right now.” Just noticing it weakens its grip. Arrogance thrives in the dark, when we don’t see it. The moment we see it clearly, we’ve already taken one step out of its trap.</p><p>Some people ask: if I’m not arrogant, will I become insecure? I think it’s the opposite. When you let go of arrogance, you become truly confident. You can say “I don’t know” without shame. You can fail without feeling worthless. You can praise others without feeling small. That’s real strength: the thing that doesn’t rely on applause to exist.</p><p>Life as a young mom (aka student aka worker) is already stressful enough: duties, exams, deadlines, family expectations, endless comparisons. I don’t need the heavy mask of arrogance on top of that. Life becomes so much lighter when I take it off. A genuine talk with a friend. Sharing my struggles without fear of judgment. Walking under the evening sky and feeling small in a beautiful way. These moments only open up when I stop trying to prove myself and allow myself to just be a regular person, not above, not below anyone else.</p><p>Think of arrogance like a balloon. The more you pump it up with praise and recognition, the bigger and higher it floats, but the easier it is to pop. One tiny needle and boom, emptiness. But if from the start, you can hold it gently in your hand, play with it, but not depend on it. You won’t fear losing it.</p><p>I’m reminded of a story: a student pours tea for a teacher, and keeps pouring until the cup overflows. The teacher smiles and says, “The cup is full. How can anything more be poured in?” Arrogance is just like that. It fills your mind until there’s no space left for new lessons, new experiences, or even the wisdom that failure can bring. Only when we stay humble—admitting we don’t know everything, we aren’t perfect — can life keep pouring fresh flavors into us.</p><p>We don’t need to prove we are better than anyone. Study, work, create for the joy of it, not for someone’s approval. Let your success be like a wildflower growing quietly by the road, fragrant, but not desperate to be seen. And if one day you catch yourself feeling arrogant, just smile, acknowledge it, and let it go.</p><p>So your heart can stay open.</p><p>Because maybe the greatest freedom isn’t standing above others, but no longer needing to. Being simply yourself—calm, unpretentious, without comparison — is already a beautiful gift. And when you reach that point, you’ll see: arrogance never truly made you happy, but letting it go just might.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=dea39b13310f\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">",

At the same time, I wanted to sharpen my skills after taking a career break, and building something from scratch felt like the best way to do that.</p><p>For the stack, I chose <strong>ReactJS</strong> for the frontend, <strong>Spring Boot</strong> for the backend, and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for the database. Together, they gave me a solid foundation to explore modern web development and practice building a complete application from end to end.</p><blockquote><strong>You can clone this project via Github </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/dlnthanh262/product-management-dashboard\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></blockquote><h3>Project Architecture 🏗️</h3><p>When I started this project, my goal was to keep the architecture <strong>simple but clear</strong> — covering the full flow from database → backend → frontend → deployment.</p><h4>Database Design 🗄️</h4><p>The application has two main entities:</p><ul><li><strong>Brand</strong> (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi)</li><li><strong>Product</strong> (belongs to a Brand, e.g., iPhone 14, Galaxy S22)</li><li><strong>User</strong> (e.g admin, user1, user2)</li></ul><p>The relationship is <strong>many-to-one</strong>: many products can belong to one brand.<br> I designed three tables:</p><p>brands: id, name, country, founded_year, website, description, created_at, updated_at, deleted</p><p>products: id, name, brand_id (FK), quantity, price, created_at, updated_at, deleted</p><p>users: id, username, password, role, created_at, updated_at, deleted</p><h4>Backend — Spring Boot ⚙️</h4><p>The backend is built with <strong>Java Spring Boot</strong> and includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Spring Data JPA</strong> for ORM and database access.</li><li><strong>Spring Security with JWT</strong> for authentication and protecting APIs.</li><li><strong>REST APIs</strong> for CRUD operations on Products and Brands.</li><li><strong>Filtering API</strong> to query products by name, brand, minPrice, and maxPrice.</li><li><strong>CSV Data Initialization</strong>: seed database with products and brands from a CSV file on first run.</li><li><strong>AWS Secrets Manager</strong> to securely fetch and manage database credentials and secret keys.</li><li><strong>Testing</strong>:<br><strong>Unit tests</strong> for service layer business logic.<br><strong>Integration tests</strong> for REST APIs, verifying end-to-end flows with the database.</li></ul><p>Example endpoint:</p><pre>GET /api/products?brand=Apple&amp;minPrice=500</pre><p>returns all Apple products priced above $500.</p><h4>Frontend — ReactJS 🎨</h4><p>The frontend is a <strong>ReactJS dashboard</strong> with:</p><ul><li><strong>Table view</strong> to list products.</li><li><strong>Filter form</strong> (brand, price range, name).</li><li><strong>Modal forms</strong> to create, edit and delete products.</li><li><strong>Statistics chart</strong> (using Chart.js/Recharts) to visualize the number of products per brand.</li><li><strong>State management</strong> using React hooks (useState, useEffect).</li></ul><p>The UI is kept simple, focusing on usability and responsiveness.</p><h4>AWS — Cloud ☁️</h4><p>The project also integrates with <strong>AWS services</strong> for secure:</p><ul><li><strong>AWS Secrets Manager</strong> to securely store and retrieve database credentials and JWT secret keys for authentication.</li><li><strong>CloudFormation</strong> to define infrastructure as code, ensuring reproducible environments.</li><li><strong>IAM</strong> for fine-grained access control.</li></ul><p>This approach keeps sensitive information out of the codebase and makes the application easier to deploy in production environments.</p><h4>Deployment ☁️</h4><ul><li><strong>Backend</strong>: deployed on <a href=\"https://render.com\">Render</a>.</li><li><strong>Frontend</strong>: deployed on <a href=\"https://render.com\">Render</a>.</li><li><strong>Database</strong>: PostgreSQL hosted on <a href=\"https://neon.com/\">Neon</a>.</li></ul><p>Whenever I push code to GitHub, Render automatically rebuild and deploy the updated app.</p><p>👉 In short, the project architecture looks like this:</p><p><strong>PostgreSQL (Neon) </strong>←→ <strong>Spring Boot APIs</strong> ←→ <strong>ReactJS Dashboard</strong> ←→ <strong>Render</strong></p><p>Building this <strong>Fullstack Product Dashboard</strong> gave me hands-on experience with ReactJS, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and AWS. From designing REST APIs and securing them with JWT, to implementing a responsive dashboard and integrating cloud secrets management, this project reflects how a modern fullstack app can be built end-to-end.</p><p>🔗 <strong>Demo Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://product-management-dashboard-1.onrender.com\">Product Dashboard (Render)</a><br> 💻 <strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/dlnthanh262/product-management-dashboard\">Source Code on GitHub</a></p><p>That’s the journey of building my dashboard! 🎉<br> I’d love to hear your thoughts — feel free to drop a <strong>comment or feedback</strong> on what you’d improve, add, or try differently.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=485fa644fda9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">",

I’m a young Asian mom, trying to raise my child while learning something new every day.</p><p>I’ve been away from programming for quite a while, long enough to forget almost everything I once knew.</p><p>Nearly two years.</p><p>During that time, while I was busy holding my baby close, the Earth kept spinning, people kept building, and countless new tools and technologies came to life. With the crazy rise of machine learning, I sometimes feel like a villager suddenly dropped into the big city.</p><p>Everything feels new.</p><p>So new that it’s scary.</p><p>I sit at my desk, staring at the laptop screen, hands falling limp, not knowing where to start again.</p><p>I open my GitHub account, scroll through old projects, make a cup of tea, glance out the window, and think…</p><p>What was I doing before I decided to cut off all screen time two years ago?</p><p>I was building websites, landing pages, and mobile apps.</p><p>And what programming languages was I using back then?</p><p>Dart. Java. HTML. CSS.</p><p>But now, everywhere I look, it’s all about AI.</p><p>Should I switch to machine learning?</p><p>I laugh at my own silly thought.</p><p>Getting a job is my top priority. Time waits for no one. While others are earning money every second, would I waste hundreds of hours chasing after a hot trend? Starting all over again from zero? That would be madness.</p><p>So I’ll return to what I already have a foundation in.</p><p>Java, or Dart? I only have time to go deep into one of them.</p><p>Java has a huge global market share. More than 90% of Fortune 500 companies still use it, not to mention its powerful ecosystem. Dart, on the other hand, is growing fast, but the community is still small.</p><p>High market share and a strong community mean more job opportunities, but also tougher competition. Still, I made my choice.</p><p>I’ll focus on Java.</p><p>One hour of theory can never compare to one hour of practice. I started building a simple web application: a product management dashboard for an electronics store.</p><p>At first, it only had basic CRUD features: create, delete, update products. Later, I added a simple chart to show product statistics by brand.</p><p>After more than 2 weeks of learning and practicing side by side, I deployed the dashboard on Render. You can check it out <a href=\"https://product-management-dashboard-1.onrender.com/\"><strong>here</strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>(The server may go to sleep if it hasn’t been used for a while. If the login page freezes, just wait 2 minutes and refresh the page.)</em></p><p>At the beginning, I struggled to balance child care, learning, and still getting enough rest. But after finishing this little project, I picked up some lessons on time management , along with two small reminders I want to write down here, mostly to remind myself.</p><p><strong>1. Sleep at night is crucial</strong></p><p>In the first three days, I forced myself to wake up at 5 am while going to bed at 1 am. That gave me more than 4 hours to study every day, and I thought it was effective, until my body gave up.</p><p>Completely. Gave. Up.</p><p>I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was moody. My head was foggy. I craved sugar like crazy.</p><p>Daytime already takes so much energy: cleaning, cooking, going to the market, taking care of my child… After 9 pm, I still sat down to study until 1 am. This endless cycle of activity with no rest was simply foolish.</p><p>So I changed my routine: still waking up at 5 am, but going to bed at 11 pm instead.</p><p>My daily plan had adjusted:</p><ul><li>30 minutes of yoga daily.</li><li>During my child’s nap, I rest at least 20 minutes instead of rushing to the market.</li><li>Cut down market trips to just twice a week.</li><li>Take my child out to play more often so he gets tired and falls asleep earlier.</li><li>Put him to bed one hour earlier.</li><li>Shortened my study time from 4 hours to 3 hours.</li></ul><p>With these small changes, my sleep went from 4 hours to 6 hours at night, plus a 30-minute nap. My energy returned. I stopped craving sugar. My mind became clearer. And my study efficiency actually went up.</p><p>A good sign, isn’t it? ^_^</p><p><strong>2. 100% focus while studying</strong></p><p>Time is precious, especially when you have a lot to get done in one day. Sometimes my to-do list feels endless, and it distracts me while I’m learning.</p><p>Coding while thinking about tomorrow’s zoo trip makes me want to open another tab and search “best things to see at ABC Zoo.”</p><p>Coding while worrying about not getting emails from recruiters makes me want to stop and fix my resume instead.</p><p>So… Don’t think about anything else.</p><p>Focus. 100%. On. What. I’m. Doing.</p><p>A cup of tea helps. Coffee works too. Even dark chocolate is fine. But never Red Bull.</p><p>Turn on a favorite playlist. Or keep the room silent. Sometimes just the sound of ocean waves is enough to pull me back into focus.</p><p>That’s it. Just two simple things.</p><p>Remember them well, me.</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=901d8669dc09\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">",
